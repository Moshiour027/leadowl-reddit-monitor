# Why LeadOwl Reddit Monitor Exists

## The Problem

We're a small team (3 people) building developer tools:

- **SnapForge** - Screenshot API for developers
- **Octa** - Calculator app for Mac
- **WatchOwl** - Visual monitoring service
- **DocForge** - PDF generation API

Our users are on Reddit. They ask questions like:

> "Looking for a reliable screenshot API"
> "Best Mac calculator for developers?"
> "Any good visual diff tools?"

When these posts appear, we want to help. Not with spam or automated messages, but with genuine, helpful responses from our team.

## The Solution

LeadOwl Reddit Monitor helps us find these posts so we can:

1. **Answer questions** - When someone asks about screenshot APIs, we can share our experience
2. **Provide support** - If someone mentions our product, we can help them
3. **Learn from feedback** - We see what users like and dislike about tools like ours

## What This ISN'T

This is NOT:

- **A spam bot** - We don't automate responses
- **A data harvesting tool** - We don't sell or share data
- **A mass scraping operation** - We monitor 12 subreddits, not all of Reddit
- **An AI training pipeline** - We don't train models on Reddit content

## The Flow

```
1. LeadOwl searches for relevant keywords
   └── "screenshot api", "mac calculator", etc.

2. Posts are collected and stored temporarily
   └── 90-day retention, then deleted

3. Our team reviews the posts
   └── Human eyes, not automation

4. We decide whether to respond
   └── Only if we can genuinely help

5. A human writes and posts the response
   └── Manually, through Reddit's interface
```

## Why We Need API Access

Without API access, we would have to manually search Reddit constantly. The API allows us to:

- Search efficiently across multiple subreddits
- Get notified when relevant posts appear
- Respond quickly while the conversation is active

We're not trying to circumvent anything. We're asking for legitimate access to do something that helps Reddit's community.

## Our Commitment

We commit to:

- Using 50% or less of allowed rate limits
- Never automating posts or comments
- Never selling or sharing data
- Deleting data after 90 days
- Responding only when we can genuinely help
- Being transparent about who we are
